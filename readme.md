## OBJECTIVE 
Finding the similarity between document samples using basics of NLP. Implementing basics of text similarity on multiple files and presenting the analysis.

## TECHNOLOGIES
Project is created with:

* Python
* Flask API
* Windows PowerShell
* Docker

## ALGORITHMS
* Cosine Similarity

## DATA
Samples given. Test check: 100% similarity for same document. High similarity between sample1 and sample2, low similarity between sample1 and sample3.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Data cleaning: converted uppercase to lower case, removed characters other than alphabets, removed punctuations and stop words.

**Cosine Similarity**: Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. Any document can be represented by thousands of attributes, each recording the frequency of a particular word (such as a keyword) or phrase in the document. Thus, each document is an object represented by what is called a term-frequency vector.
I have tried implementing similar logic by using dictionary key:value pair as word as key and its frequency as value. if the key is same in two document samples, then multiply the values and add all of them to get the final dot product. Divide this summation by dot products of both the documnets to get the final percentage. 

numerator = dotproduct(D1, D2)

denominator = (dotproduct(D1, D1) * dotproduct(D2, D2)) ** (1 / 2)

result = (numerator / denominator)*100

## Alternative Approach:
Could have used Jaccard Similarity:

**Jaccard Similarity**: The Jaccard similarity index (sometimes called the Jaccard similarity coefficient) compares members for two sets to see which members are shared and which are distinct. It’s a measure of similarity for the two sets of data, with a range from 0% to 100%. The higher the percentage, the more similar the two populations.

How to calculate: The formula to find the Index is:

Jaccard Index = (the number in both sets) / (the number in either set) * 100

The same formula in notation is: J(X,Y) = |X∩Y| / |X∪Y|

## RESULTS

I have used python function to calculate the text similarity rather and deployed it as docker image using flask. The Docurhub repository is publicaly accessible and can be used by anyone to fetch and run the docker image (app) on their system

## INSTRUCTIONS
Follow the instructions to successfully run the created app:
These instructions are for Windows Powershell

<b>COPY all the above file into one single folder before running the python
file.</b>

<b>TO RUN PYTHON FILE LOCALY AND CHECK THE RESULT:</b>

1.  Run app.py with templates subfolder containing index.html file in
    the same project folder. 
    Document\_similarity --\>app.py, templates
    -\>\> index.html
2.  The link to run app locally on web browser is "0.0.0.0:5000" for
    linux/ubuntu. For windows, type "localhost:5000" on web browser to
    run the app.

Alternative:

1.  Run Document\_Similarity.py on windows and check the link in console
    to run the app.

<b> RUNNING DOCKER IMAGE LOCALLY:</b>

1.  Build docker image : docker build -t flaskapp:version1 .
2.  Run the images : docker run -it -p 5000:5000 flaskapp:version1
3.  (Optional) Check if the container is running: sudo docker ps
4.  Open browser and hit http://localhost:5000/ or "0.0.0.0:5000" for
    linux/ubuntu.
5.  To stop the container: docker kill <container-id>

<b>RUNNING DOCKER IMAGE FROM DOCKERHUB:</b>

Pushing the image:

1.  Create Docker hub account.
2.  Create a repository in dockerhub.
3.  Add a tag to the local docker image : docker tag flaskapp:version1
    maitraiyee/flaskapp:version1
4.  Push the image to dockerhub : docker push
    maitraiyee/flaskapp:version1

Fetching and Running the image:

1.  Pull the image : docker pull maitraiyee/flaskapp:version1
2.  Run the downloaded image : docker run -it -p 5000:5000
    maitraiyee/flaskapp:version1

Note : The above instructions are to run the docker on windows, in app.py localhost-0.0.0.0 has been used so as to make the app version compatible with linux; ubuntu. please use "localhost:5000" in the web browser to run the same app on windows.
